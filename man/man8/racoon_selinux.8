.SH "NAME"
racoon_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the racoon processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the racoon processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  racoon policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run racoon with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow racoon to read shadow, you must turn on the racoon_read_shadow boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P racoon_read_shadow 1
.EE

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the racoon_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the racoon_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux racoon policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their racoon processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for racoon:


.EX
.PP
.B racoon_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the racoon_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the racoon_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B racoon_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the racoon_tmp_t type, if you want to store racoon temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux racoon policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their racoon processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for racoon:

.EX
.B racoon_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux user type racoon_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.
