.SH "NAME"
NetworkManager_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the NetworkManager processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the NetworkManager processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The NetworkManager processes execute with the NetworkManager_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier. 

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep NetworkManager_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The NetworkManager_t SELinux type can be entered via the "NetworkManager_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the NetworkManager_t domain are the following:"

/usr/s?bin/wpa_supplicant, /usr/sbin/wpa_supplicant, /sbin/wpa_supplicant, /usr/sbin/nm-system-settings, /usr/sbin/wicd, /usr/s?bin/NetworkManager, /usr/sbin/NetworkManagerDispatcher
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux NetworkManager policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their NetworkManager processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for NetworkManager:

.EX
.B NetworkManager_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux NetworkManager policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their NetworkManager processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for NetworkManager:


.EX
.PP
.B NetworkManager_etc_rw_t 
.EE

- Set files with the NetworkManager_etc_rw_t type, if you want to treat the files as NetworkManager etc read/write content.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections(/.*)?, /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager\.conf

.EX
.PP

.EX
.PP
.B NetworkManager_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the NetworkManager_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as NetworkManager log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/var/log/wpa_supplicant.*, /var/log/wicd.*

.EX
.PP
.B NetworkManager_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the NetworkManager_tmp_t type, if you want to store NetworkManager temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B NetworkManager_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the NetworkManager_unit_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as NetworkManager unit content.


.EX
.PP
.B NetworkManager_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the NetworkManager_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the NetworkManager files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/etc/wicd/wired-settings.conf, /var/lib/wicd(/.*)?, /etc/dhcp/wired-settings.conf, /etc/dhcp/wireless-settings.conf, /etc/wicd/manager-settings.conf, /etc/dhcp/manager-settings.conf, /etc/wicd/wireless-settings.conf, /var/lib/NetworkManager(/.*)?

.EX
.PP
.B NetworkManager_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the NetworkManager_var_run_t type, if you want to store the NetworkManager files under the /run directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/var/run/nm-dhclient.*, /var/run/wpa_supplicant(/.*)?, /var/run/NetworkManager\.pid, /var/run/wpa_supplicant-global, /var/run/nm-dns-dnsmasq\.conf, /var/run/NetworkManager(/.*)?

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type NetworkManager_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.
