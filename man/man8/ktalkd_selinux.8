.SH "NAME"
ktalkd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ktalkd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ktalkd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the ktalkd_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the ktalkd_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ktalkd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ktalkd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ktalkd:


.EX
.PP
.B ktalkd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ktalkd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ktalkd_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/in\.talkd, /usr/bin/ktalkd, /usr/sbin/in\.ntalkd

.EX
.PP
.B ktalkd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ktalkd_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as ktalkd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B ktalkd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ktalkd_tmp_t type, if you want to store ktalkd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B ktalkd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ktalkd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the ktalkd files under the /run directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux ktalkd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ktalkd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for ktalkd:

.EX
.TP 5
.B ktalkd_port_t 
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
udp 517,518
.EE
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux ktalkd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ktalkd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for ktalkd:

.EX
.B ktalkd_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
