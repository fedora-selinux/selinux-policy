.SH "NAME"
shorewall_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the shorewall processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the shorewall processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The shorewall processes execute with the shorewall_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier. 

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep shorewall_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The shorewall_t SELinux type can be entered via the "shorewall_var_lib_t,shorewall_exec_t" file types.  The default entrypoint paths for the shorewall_t domain are the following:"

/var/lib/shorewall-lite(/.*)?, /var/lib/shorewall(/.*)?, /var/lib/shorewall6(/.*)?, /sbin/shorewall6?, /sbin/shorewall-lite, /usr/sbin/shorewall-lite, /usr/sbin/shorewall6?
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux shorewall policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their shorewall processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for shorewall:

.EX
.B shorewall_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux shorewall policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their shorewall processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for shorewall:


.EX
.PP
.B shorewall_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_etc_t type, if you want to store shorewall files in the /etc directories.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/etc/shorewall-lite(/.*)?, /etc/shorewall(/.*)?

.EX
.PP
.B shorewall_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the shorewall_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/sbin/shorewall6?, /sbin/shorewall-lite, /usr/sbin/shorewall-lite, /usr/sbin/shorewall6?

.EX
.PP
.B shorewall_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the shorewall_initrc_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/shorewall, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/shorewall-lite

.EX
.PP
.B shorewall_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_lock_t type, if you want to treat the files as shorewall lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.PP
.B shorewall_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as shorewall log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B shorewall_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_tmp_t type, if you want to store shorewall temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B shorewall_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the shorewall files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/var/lib/shorewall-lite(/.*)?, /var/lib/shorewall(/.*)?, /var/lib/shorewall6(/.*)?

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type shorewall_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B initrc_var_run_t

	/var/run/utmp
.br
	/var/run/random-seed
.br
	/var/run/runlevel\.dir
.br
	/var/run/setmixer_flag
.br

.br
.B shorewall_lock_t

	/var/lock/subsys/shorewall
.br

.br
.B shorewall_log_t

	/var/log/shorewall.*
.br

.br
.B shorewall_tmp_t


.br
.B shorewall_var_lib_t

	/var/lib/shorewall(/.*)?
.br
	/var/lib/shorewall6(/.*)?
.br
	/var/lib/shorewall-lite(/.*)?
.br

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the shorewall_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the shorewall_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
