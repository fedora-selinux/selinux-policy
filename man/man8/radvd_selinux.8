.SH "NAME"
radvd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the radvd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the radvd processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The radvd processes execute with the radvd_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep radvd_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The radvd_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBradvd_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the radvd_t domain are the following:

/usr/sbin/radvd
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux radvd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their radvd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for radvd:

.EX
.B radvd_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a radvd_t
can be used to make the process type radvd_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  radvd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run radvd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd server, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean. Disabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P nscd_use_shm 1

.EE

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd server for the radvd_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the radvd_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type radvd_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B radvd_var_run_t

	/var/run/radvd(/.*)?
.br
	/var/run/radvd\.pid
.br

.br
.B root_t

	/
.br
	/initrd
.br

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux radvd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their radvd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B EQUIVALENCE DIRECTORIES

.PP
radvd policy stores data with multiple different file context types under the /var/run/radvd directory.  If you would like to store the data in a different directory you can use the semanage command to create an equivalence mapping.  If you wanted to store this data under the /srv dirctory you would execute the following command:
.PP
.B semanage fcontext -a -e /var/run/radvd /srv/radvd
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/radvd
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the radvd, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t radvd_etc_t '/srv/radvd/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/myradvd_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for radvd:


.EX
.PP
.B radvd_etc_t
.EE

- Set files with the radvd_etc_t type, if you want to store radvd files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.PP
.B radvd_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the radvd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the radvd_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B radvd_initrc_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the radvd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the radvd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B radvd_var_run_t
.EE

- Set files with the radvd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the radvd files under the /run or /var/run directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/var/run/radvd(/.*)?, /var/run/radvd\.pid

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
