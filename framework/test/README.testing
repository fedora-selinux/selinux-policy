The current code base contains a testbed for setroubleshoot, here is
how you can use it.

Impatient users can skip to "Simple Testing Scenario:" :-)

If you want to test "in the tree" (e.g. not installed) then export
PYTHONPATH=/repository/framework where repository is the root of
mercurial tree. Note, you much have done a .autogen.sh followed by a
make because this creates the necessary symbolic link "setroubleshoot"
which allows imports from setroubleshoot to be resolved by python.

The framework/test/data/audit directory contains a set of log
files. Each log file contains audit records which define an AVC. You
may add log files here, just make sure they are syntactically correct
audit messages, in particular the audit event id's must be valid and
share the same serial number.

In framework/test you will find a test program called
test_setroubleshootd. It emulates an audispd socket. Thus the
setroubleshootd daemon can connect to that socket and will behave
exactly as if the kernel were generating the AVC's without the need to
generate the AVC through the kernel. The test_setroubleshootd program
does this by reading one or more of the log files and transmitting the
audit records through the socket.

To avoid colliding with the actual audispd sockets both the test
program and setroubleshootd must be told to use an alternate
socket. By default test_setroubleshootd uses /tmp/audispd_events,
setroubleshootd can be passed this command line arg to override it's
normal socket selection:

setroubleshootd -c audit.text_protocol_socket_path=/tmp/audispd_events

The setroubleshoot init script has been augmented to start
setroubleshootd in test mode, setting the socket path. If you want to
test an installed setroubleshoot you can use the init script and add
test as an extra argument. You can get verbose console output if you
add verbose as an extra argument. The you can easily test this way:

% service setroubleshoot start test

or

% service setroubleshoot start test verbose

If you're working in the tree you have to bypass #! script interpreter
otherwise it won't respect the PYTHONPATH override. To run the daemon
in the tree do this:

% sudo python setroubleshootd -c audit.text_protocol_socket_path=/tmp/audispd_events


Prior to running the daemon it's a good idea to start
test_setroubleshootd so when the daemon comes up it will automatically
connect to it, otherwise you may have to wait 60 seconds for a
connection retry.

test_setroubleshootd runs in the foreground with simple command line
input given by a ">" prompt. Currently at that prompt you can type

send
send all
send next
send <file>
list
quit
help

send (and send all) sends the content of all log files.
send next sends the next log file in the list of log files.
send <file> [<file>] sends a specific log file(s) (one can use globbing)
list dumps the list of available log files.
quit exits the program.
help tells you what you can do.

Each command can be abbreviated by using its first character, thus
"send" can be entered as "s".

The previous command will be reissued if you enter a blank line. The
previous command is shown in brackets. Thus you can just keep hitting
return to repeat a command, e.g. to step though the list of files one
at a time:

> send next <return>
> [send next] <return>
> [send next] <return>
> [send next] <return>


test_setroubleshooted also accepts this optional arguments.

-a --audit-socket       audit message socket (default=/tmp/audispd_events)
-o --out                - for stdout, unix for AF_UNIX socket
-s --srcfiles           shell glob syntax specifying src log file to send
-f --format binary|text|host_text       output audit record format
-c --config section.option=value        set a configuration value
-h --help               display help info
-D --test-file-dir      search for test files in this directory (default=data/audit)
-v --verbose            turn on verbose output

Once the daemon is running the sealert client can connect to it, this
will happen automatically if you run the daemon via the init script
because the daemon announces it presence on DBUS.

Simple Testing Scenario:
------------------------

1) install packages or make install from src
2) run framework/test_setroubleshootd in a terminal window
3) % service restart setroubleshoot test
4) in the test_setroubleshootd terminal window type "s" to send all the files
5) watch the results live in sealert

Future Enhancements:
--------------------

It would be nice to run the test standalone and to verify the right
plugin fired for the matching log file. There is code there already to
support this but it's not finished. The basic idea is each log file
can contain processing directives and comments (that support is
already there). A processing directive would specify which plugin(s)
should fire.

test_setroubleshootd is capable of running the setroubleshootd daemon
as a child process. The setroubleshootd daemon has a special
configuration option which prints the plugin which fired during
analysis (all this support is already there).

The envisioned scenario is test_setroubleshootd runs the daemon as a
child, it sends it log files, as it reads the log file it sees a
processing directive specifying which plugin should be triggered, the
daemon prints out the plugin after analysis, the test program compares
the two to assure they match.

Most of this code is there, it just needs to be "connected together"
and given a little love. In the mean time the interactive test mode
works well.

Other Tools:
------------

The program audisp_listen will listen on an audispd socket and dump to
stdout whatever appears on the socket. This can be useful to monitor
or debug what the real time audit system is generating.
