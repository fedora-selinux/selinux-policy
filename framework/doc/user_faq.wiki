== What is the basic structure of the alert browser? == #alert-browser

The alert browser is allows you to view and operate on alerts stored
in an alert database. The browser is modeled after an email client
where each alert corresponds to an email message.

The browser window is composed of 3 components:

* Alert List

* Alert Detail 

* [#sealert-statusbar Status Bar]

[[Image(source:doc/setroubleshoot_browser_structure.png)]]

The alert list shows you a list of all the alerts and is divided into
columns:

Filter::

    Toggle a flag to prevent being notified when this alert repeats.

Date::

    The date and time of the most recent occurrence of this
    [#denial-event denial event]

Count::

    How many times has this [#denial-event denial event] been
    triggered since it was first reported.

Category::

    The category (class) this [#denial-event denial event] belongs
    to (e.g.: "Web Server", "FTP", "File System", "Cron", etc.)

Summary::

    A brief description of the [#denial-event denial event]

All the columns in the alert list can be [#sealert-column-sort sorted].

== How am I alerted when an AVC denial occurs? == #alert-notification

* You can receive alerts on your desktop

* You can receive alerts as [#email-alerts email messages]

If you are in a desktop session and sealert is running (the default)
you will be notified when the setroubleshoot daemon sends a message to
sealert. sealert first checks if the alert is being [#alert-filtering
filtered], if so sealert remains passively quiet in the background. If
the alert is not filtered then sealert puts the setroubleshoot icon
[[Image(source:gui/setroubleshoot_icon.png, 24, align=middle, nolink)]]
up in the status area. It then briefly displays a
notification balloon indicating an AVC denial has occurred and directs
the user to click on the setroubleshoot icon to view it. The
notification will time out after a few seconds so it it not
obstructively annoying.

Note: The status icon is only displayed if sealert is running when the
alert arrives, past unviewed alerts from previous sessions do not
cause the status icon to be displayed, instead you can
[#display-browser display the browser] to view them. This is an example of
what a notification looks like:

[[Image(source:doc/setroubleshoot_notification.png)]]

You may also have setroubleshoot send you an [#email-alerts email alert].

== Can setroubleshoot send me an email when an alert fires? == #email-alerts

Besides desktop notifications setroubleshoot can also send you an
alert as an email message. This might be preferable when there is [#no-desktop
no desktop], when you want to archive alerts, automatically
post-process alerts, or monitor remote systems.

There are two ways to configure email alerts:

1. Use the alert browser GUI

2. Manually edit the mailing list

The easiest way to configure email alert is to [#display-browser
display the browser] and then from the File menu select "Edit Email
Alert List ...". A dialog will pop up:

[[Image(source:doc/setroubleshoot_email_preferences.png)]]

With the dialog you can:

 * add an address by entering it in the input box and clicking add

 * delete one or more addresses by selecting them in the list and
   clicking delete or hitting the delete button.

 * edit an address already in the list by clicking on it and typing.

 * modify the filtering for an address by clicking on the filter and
selecting one of the options from the drop down list.

The filter option for email alerts apply to all alerts, unlike in the
alert browser you cannot have a different filter for each alert. Here
are the filtering options for email alerts:

Ignore After First Alert::
  This is the default. The address will receive an alert only the
  first time it fires. Email alerts will be filtered for the alert
  in question for all subsequent firings of the alert.

Never Ignore::
  An email alert will be sent for every instance of every alert to
  this address.

Ignore Always::
  Email alerts will never be sent for this address. One can use this
  to temporarily disable alerts to an address.

But I don't have a desktop session on the node I want to receive email
alerts for? For instance how can I monitor a server?

You can directly edit the file
/var/lib/setroubleshoot/email_alert_recipients. This is the file the
above GUI is modifying. The format of the file is line based, the hash
(#) character is the comment character, the comment extends to the end
of the line, blank lines are ignored.

Addresses are one per line, optionally following the address
(seperated by whitespace) are options in the form
name=value. Currently there is only one option:

filter_type::
  after_first
  never
  always

Here is an example:
{{{
jdennis@redhat.com                       filter_type=after_first
}}}

== What information is displayed in the status bar? == #sealert-statusbar

At the bottom of the sealert browser window is a status bar. The
status bar is divided into 4 areas:

connection status::

    This displays the status of the connection to the setroubleshootd
    daemon. If you are not currently connected sealert will
    periodically attempt to reconnect displaying messages to that
    effect in the message area.

visit database::

    This is the alert database the browser is currently visiting
    (e.g. viewing). The default is the 'Audit Listener', which is the
    database of alerts received from the audit subsystem and managed
    by the setroubleshootd daemon. If you scan a log file the browser
    will switch to visiting the database created from the log file
    scan. You can switch which database is being viewed via the View
    menu.

message area:

    This is where temporary messages of minor importance are
    displayed.

progress bar::

    During time consuming operations such as reading in new data or
    scanning log files the progress bar will either indicate an
    estimated percentage of completion or if an estimate is not
    possible that an operation is underway.

[[Image(source:/doc/setroubleshoot_statusbar.png)]]

== How do I export alert information (clipboard, file, print)? ==

You can export selected alerts by:

* copying the alert to the clipboard (Edit|Copy Alert)

* writing the alert to a file (File|Save As...)

* printing the alert (File|Print...)

=== Copying to the clipboard does not work as I expect ===

There are two ways to copy to the clipboard:

Copy::

    This copies the selected items in the alert view to the
    clipboard. The alert view is rendered as HTML (e.g. a web
    page). The HTML renderer is asked to perform the copy
    operation. The current HTML renderer is not very smart about
    translating table and other HTML elements into text on the
    clipboard. You get what the HTML renderer is capable of
    producing. Future releases of setroubleshoot may upgrade to a more
    capable HTML renderer.

Copy Alert::

    The copies the entire alert as TEXT and places it on the
    clipboard. The text is formatted to resemble the HTML
    version. When sharing an alert with someone else or pasting it
    into another application "Copy Alert" will probably provide the
    best text because it preserves formatting such as line
    breaks. Although because it includes everything you may have to
    delete some text you consider superfluous.


== How can I sort the alert list? == #sealert-column-sort

Each column heading in the alert list is sortable. Just click on the
column heading to change the sort order.

== What date is associated with an alert? ==

Alerts store two seperate dates in their description. The date/time
the alert was first seen and the date/time the alert was last seen
(most recent occurance). The date/time column in the browser shows
date/time of the most recent occurance (last seen). The alert detail
view shows both date/time's.

== I think SELinux is the cause of a problem, how can setroubleshoot help find it? ==

In this instance you probably know or suspect the problem occurred at
a certain time or in a certain component.

If you think the problem is related to a certain component, for
instance your web server, then [#display-browser display the browser]
and [#sealert-column-sort sort] the Category column. This will group
alerts by Category, look for any alerts in the "Web Server" category.

If you think the problem occurred in at a certain time then
[#sealert-column-sort sort] the Date column. Find the alerts which
occurred within the time period the problem manifested itself.

== I've got a log file with AVC messages in it, can setroubleshoot analyze it for me? ==

Yes. By default setroubleshoot listens for AVC messages arriving from the
audit subsystem and then feeds those AVC messages into its analysis
engine. However setroubleshoot can also open a log file containing AVC
messages, parse those AVC messages and feed them into its analysis
engine just as if they had arrived from the audit subsystem. To
analyze a log file go to the File menu and select "Scan
logfile...". This will open a file chooser dialog which will allow you
to pick a file to analyze.

The file is opened by the sealert process which runs with your
permissions, not root permissions. Therefore any file you wish to
analyze must be readable by you. Some system log file are not world
readable. If this is the case then your best option is to copy the
file as root to a temporary location and make it readable.

As the analysis engine runs on the log file it builds an alert
database (e.g. post processed). The most significant effect is to
collapse recurring problems into single alerts with a repeat count
(see [#alert-description alert description]).

The browser will switch to viewing (visiting) the alert database
created by scanning the log file. The fact the browser is now viewing
a different set of alerts is reported in the [#sealert-statusbar
status bar]. You may switch which set of alerts you're viewing with
the [#sealert-visit View menu].

The alerts generated from log file scanning do not contain any
environmental information (e.g. version information etc.), see
[#alert-environment-info alert environment] for an explanation of why.

=== How can I correlate alerts with the log file line numbers ? ===

Each alert in the detail section will display the line numbers which
contributed to the alert. Recall that [#alert-description alerts] are
single descriptions of a denial which may have occurred multiple times
in the log file, the line numbers will show you all the places in the
log file where this same issue was identified. In addition
[#denial-event denial events] are composed from multiple [#avc-message
AVC messages] which may or may not be contiguous in the log file
(typically denial events have their independent AVC messages in close
proximity, thus any given denial event tends to be "clustered"). The
line numbers reported are for every AVC message which contributed to a
denial event and each alert may be composed from multiple denial
evants (e.g. the report count).

=== The /var/log/messages log file lists an AVC denial, can setroubleshoot give me more information? ===

Sometimes. As a helpful service when setroubleshootd is running and
catches an AVC denial it will write the AVC message into the system
log file along with the alert identitifer (e.g. local-id). You can run
sealert from the command line with the -l (e.g. lookup) option passing
the ID reported in the log file. sealert will then print the alert
matching that ID to stdout.

== Alerts are not showing up, what's wrong? ==

I know I'm getting AVC denials but I'm not getting alerts on my
desktop. What might be going wrong and how can I fix it?

Setroubleshoot is composed of independent parts, a daemon which runs
as a system service with root privileges (setroubleshootd) and a user
GUI tool typically run on the desktop (sealert) which communicates
with the setroubleshootd daemon. Both setroubleshootd and sealert must
be running to receive alerts on your desktop.

1. Verify the setroubleshootd daemon is running. The connection icon
in the [#sealert-statusbar status bar] is a quick way to check the
sealert is connected to the setroubleshootd daemon.

Otherwise to perform a more thorough, setroubleshootd is installed as
a system service called setroubleshoot (no trailing 'd' in the
name). Use the 'service' command to check its status like this:

{{{
% service setroubleshoot status
}}}

You should get one of two messages:

setroubleshootd is stopped

-OR-

setroubleshootd (pid 12345) is running...

If it's running, this part is good, otherwise start the service:

{{{
% service setroubleshoot start
}}}

If you want to make sure the setroubleshoot service is always running,
even after a reboot you'll want to enable the service with the
chkconfig command, you would do it like this:

{{{
chkconfig setroubleshoot on
}}}

2. Verify the sealert user process is running

{{{
% ps ax | grep sealert
}}}

This should show a running sealert process. If it's not running
[#sealert-start start sealert].

If it is running [#display-browser display the browser] and make sure
the alert you are expecting is not [#alert-filtering filtered]

Note [#alert-notification alert notification] only occurs when the
alert arrives, but the alert should be visible in the browser.

If all of these things fail then setroubleshoot may be experiencing
technical difficulties, check the [#logging logs] for error messages.

== How is sealert started? == #sealert-start
sealert is configured to start with your login session. It should be
running after you login. If you've just installed the sealert RPM you
may need to start the setroubleshoot service (see above) and logout
and back in again to start sealert. Or you can manually start sealert
with this command:

% sealert -s

Note: when you start sealart with the -s option you're telling it to
start as a desktop session service. It runs in the background and does
not display anything until an alert arrives from the setroubleshoot
daemon. If you want the browser to appear when you start sealert
use the -b option instead.

== How do I display the alert browser? == #display-browser

There are 3 ways to display the alert browser:

1. From the menu 'System --> Administration --> SELinux Troubleshooter

2. If the setroubleshoot icon is showing in the status area, you can
click on it.

3. From the command line, use the command 'sealert -b'

Note: sealert runs continuously in the background as a desktop session
service. When you use the sealert -b option to display the browser or
use the System --> Administration menu (which simply runs sealert -b)
a message is sent to the running copy of sealert asking it to display
the alert browser, if the sealert service is not running it will be
started first. The command 'sealert -b' sends the message and exits.

== Does sealert run continuously? ==

When run as a normal desktop tool sealert runs continuously. Even when
you close the sealert browser window the process continues to run in
the background. The reason why it does this is because it is quietly
waiting for a AVC alert from the setroubleshoot service daemon.

Should it recieve a message from the daemon it will put up the status
icon and notification message and wait for you to click on the icon to
view the message. However, if you have filtered the AVC (told
setroubleshoot you don't want to be bothered with a particular alert)
then sealert will not notify you.

Follow these instructions to [#stop-sealert stop sealert].

== How can I stop sealert? == #stop-sealert

If you want to stop the sealert service do this:
{{{
% sealert -q
}}}
This sends a message to the running sealert service and asks it to
quit.

== Some alerts are meaningful to me, others are just an annoyance, can I filter them somehow? == #alert-filtering

Yes. Open the alert browser, find the alert you which to ignore and
click the 'filter' checkbox associated with the alert. You will no
longer be notified of these alerts. Later if you wish you can uncheck
the filter box and you will get alerts again.

Please note, if you permanently [#delete-alert delete an alert]
setroubleshoot permanently forgets everything about the alert,
including your desire to filter it. If the alert repeats again after
you've deleted it previously you'll have to click the filter box
again.

TIP: You can mark an alert for deletion and then hide all alerts
marked for deletion. This is one way to continue to filter an alert
but not have it appear in the alert browser.


== Does setroubleshoot have a log I can check? == #logging

Yes. The setroubleshootd daemon and the sealert user tool are seperate
processes and have seperate logging.

The setroubleshoot daemon logs its operations to
/var/log/setroubleshoot/setroubleshootd.log.

The sealert user tool does not log by default, but you can get it log
by editing the [#config-file config file].

By default it only logs warnings and errors. Error messages are also
written to the standard syslog (/var/log/messages).

You can change the verbosity of the logging messages by editing the
[#config-file config file].

The config file has two sections in it for logging, one for each process:
[sealert_log]
[setroubleshootd_log]

Find the section you wish to modify, there are a number of options,
most of which are documented in the config file. The 'level' option
changes the verbosity, setting the level to 'debug' is a good choice
if your trying to diagnose a problem. The 'filename' option sets the
file where logging will be directed. If no file is set logging goes to
the console. By default there is no file set for sealert because its a
per user log file and by default we don't want to be writing user
files. The 'console' flag will also send logging messages to the
console if otherwise they are also being writtin to a log file (if
there is no log file, messages are directed to the console). There is
also a 'categories' list which will allow you to select functional
areas to log. By default all categories are logged.

== Does setroubleshoot have a config file? == #config-file

Yes. /etc/setroubleshoot/setroubleshoot.cfg

The format of the config file is a standard 'ini' divided into
sections. Each section is labeled inside square brackets, e.g. all the
email related options are in the section [email].

Most entries in the file are documented directly above the option.

The config file is read when the process (setroubleshootd or sealert)
is started. If you change the config file you'll have to restart the
process.

== How do I switch which alerts I'm viewing? == #sealert-visit

Alerts are always collected into an alert database (see
[#alert-description What is an alert]). There is an alert database for
collecting alerts from the audit subsystem, an alert database for any
log files which were scanned, etc. You can use the View menu to select
which database the browser is visiting (e.g. viewing). The alert
database currently being visited (viewed) is displayed in the [#sealert-statusbar
status bar].

== What is an alert? == #alert-description

An alert is a general description of something SELinux prevented. It
is not a specific instance of a [#denial-event SELinux denial]. This
is because in almost all cases users are most interested in a
"problem" such as "the web server can't read home directories" as well
as how often that "problem" is occurring. An alert is the general
problem describing a SELinux denial. Alerts may have multiple
instances, e.g. this problem occurred 15 times.

An alert is the linking of a [#alert-signature general denial] with
analysis information and any metadata such as [#alert-environment-info
environmental information], time stamps, occurance counts, etc.

Every time a denial event is recognized it is converted to an
[#alert-signature alert signature], a general way of describing the
denial event. Then the [#alert-database alert database] is consulted
to see if the denial has been seen before, if so its report count is
incremented, otherwise it's added to the database. Irregardless of
whether the denial was previously in the alert database or not a full
analysis is run on the denial event to produce a [#analysis-report
analysis report]. The most recent analysis report of the denial event
is stored in the alert database along with how many times it occurred
and when it last occurred. This means the description of the denial
event (e.g. the [#analysis-report analysis-report] is based on the
most recent occurrence of the denial event.

=== What is an AVC message? === #avc-message

The kernel audit subsystem emits a message whenever SELinux denies
permission (or would have denied permission). These messages describe
the particulars of what the kernel is doing at the moment and is not a
complete desciption of the denial (which we term [#denial-event denial
event]. As the kernel continues to process the system call which
triggered the AVC additional messages may be emitted independently
which when combined fully describe the denial event. Thus any one AVC
message may be an incomplete description of the denial event. Each AVC
message is tagged with the denial event it is part of and post
processiong tools such as setroubleshoot can assemble independent AVC
messages into complete events.

=== What is a Denial Event? === #denial-event

A denial event is exactly one operation SELinux denied. It may be
reported by the kernel as multiple [#avc-message AVC
messages]. Specialized software such as setroubleshoot has the ability
to merge independent AVC messages into single denial events. People
often use the term AVC when they really mean denial event.

setroubleshoot uses a general method to "label" [#denial-event denial
events] called an [#alert-signature alert signature].

== What is environment information and why is it sometimes missing? == #alert-environment-info

Environment infomation describes the "context" in which the
[#denial-event denial event] occurred. It is the information most
useful for rectifying a problem, filing a bug report etc. It lists
items such as the version of the SELinux policy, the version of the
operating system, the RPM package and version the software which
triggered the denial came from, etc.

However envionmental information can only be reliably gathered at the
moment the denial occurred. If one queried the system for
environmental information at a later point in time, for instance
during log file scanning, then the enviroment may have changed in the
interim which would then attach incorrect infomation to the alert. The
same problem occurs if the log file being scanned was generated on
another system.

Therefore environment information by default is only gathered when
alerts enter the system via real time audit monitoring (e.g. audit
listener). This is the only time enviroment information is guaranteed
to be correct. Alerts generated from log file scans do not display
environment information.

== What is an alert database? == #alert-database

A general denial (as opposed to a specific instance of the denial) is
described by its [#alert-signature signature]. Alert databases store
information about a denial such as its analysis, how many times this
denial has occurred, when was the first and most recent time it was
reported, etc. The alert is looked up in the database by its
signature.

== What is an alert signatures? == #alert-signature

Alert signatures are a means to describe a general denial. For most
users this can be thought of as an "SELinux problem" such as "the web
server can't execute CGI scripts". A signature collects the minimal
information necessary to uniquely descibe a SELinux denial, but no
more information than is necessary otherwise the signature would begin
to describe specific instances rather than a general problem. However the
content of the signature must be unique enough so that denial events
which are fundamentally unique are not coalesced into a single
description.

Signatures allow alerts to be "portable" across systems. For example
if you're managing a collection of nodes the same signature can be
used to reference the same problem on all the nodes. As a system
administrator it is quite useful to see nodes X,Y, and Z are all
showing the same problem, but node W is not. Portable signatures also
make bug reporting much more useful because one signature can be used
for every person reporting the same problem.

Alerts are always referenced by their signature. In essence an alert
is the alert analysis and metadata which is looked up by its signature
in the alert database.

== What is an analysis report? == #analysis-report

When a [#denial-event denial event] enters the system for analysis
each analysis plugin is given an opportunity to examine the denial
event. If the plugin recognizes the denial event it creates an
analysis report providing as much information as it can about the
event such as a summmary, a detailed description, how one might fix
the problem, etc. The analysis report is the bulk of the information
presented to the user when he or she views an alert. The analysis
report may optionally be merged with [#alert-environment-info
environmental information].

== Can I delete alerts? == #delete-alert

Yes. The alert browser is modeled after an email IMAP client which may
be familiar. Deletion is a two step process. First an alert is marked
for deletion. This is done by selecting one or more alerts in the
alert list and choosing the "Mark Delete" option from either the Edit
menu or the right-click popup menu. At this point the alert is not
actually deleted, it is just marked as pending for deletion, this is
indicated by drawing a strike-out line through the alert. One can
[#hide-deleted-alerts hide] alerts marked for deletion.

To permanently delete the alerts marked for deletion choose the
"Remove All Marked for Deletion" command from either the Edit menu or
the right-click popup menu.

== Can I hide alerts marked for deletion? == #hide-deleted-alerts

Yes. Use the View menu and toggle the "Hide Deleted" option. Alerts
marked for deletion will not be visible in the alert list. They will
remain in the alert database until the "Remove All Marked for
Deletion" command is executed. You may toggle the hide option on and
off.

== Are there shortcuts for common operations in the browser? ==

Yes, right clicking in the browser alert list will bring up a popup
menu with common commands.

== Does setroubleshoot write syslog messages? == #setroubleshoot-syslog

Yes. As a courtesy or alternate way to discover an AVC denial occurred
setroubleshoot will write a message into syslog with the result of its
analysis of the denial event, for example:

{{{
SELinux is preventing /sbin/busybox (dhcpc_t) "ptrace" access to exe (ypbind_t).      For complete SELinux messages. run sealert -l 66cb5378-d593-42b3-9b6e-68da2cf09628
}}}

The first part is the "summary" information for the alert. What
follows it is the ID (local identifier) for the alert in the
setroubleshoot database. This ID can be used to lookup the alert using
sealert in [#sealert-commandline command line mode]. This will dump
the alert to stdout. One can also search for the matching alert in the
alert browser. The expectation is using the ID in the browser will be
rare, if you're using the browser you probably don't need to lookup
the alert, but sometimes this is helpful if you're trying to match a
syslog entry with what you're seeing in the browser.

== sealert command line operation == #sealert-commandline
